                    <p>

                        I am a Mathematics graduate with a strong foundation in digital marketing along with experience in events management. Alongside these roles, I enjoy exploring my passion for music as a part-time DJ. Currently, I am actively pursuing my goal of becoming a proficient full-stack developer through dedicated training and hands-on learning.

                        Why this role?
                        I have always been a keen creative, whilst simultaneously fascinated by mathematics. This meant that career-wise, I was always torn between going into a more creative direction and a more analytical role. The Full-engineer role interests me greatly as it seems to be the best of both worlds. It gives me an opportunity to explore my passion for logic and problem solving, whilst having creative freedom.
